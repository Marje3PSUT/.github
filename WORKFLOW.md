## Typical Workflow  

### 1. **Checking for Existing Issues**  
Before starting work, check the [issue board](https://github.com/orgs/Marje3PSUT/projects/1) to see if a similar issue already exists.  
- If it does, follow the discussion or comment if you have additional input.  
- If it doesnâ€™t, create a new issue describing the problem or feature request.  

### 2. **Issue Triage**  
New issues are automatically added to the **Triaging** section of the issue board.  
- Maintainers will review the issue and determine if it should be worked on.  
- If approved, the issue moves to the **To Do** section, where it waits for someone to pick it up.  

### 3. **Assignment & Progress**  
- When a contributor expresses interest, a maintainer assigns them to the issue.  
- The issue status is updated to **In Progress**.  

### 4. **Development**  
- Fork the repository and clone it locally.  
- Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes.  
- Follow best practices and write clear, maintainable code.  

### 5. **Creating a Pull Request (PR)**  
When your changes are ready:  
- Push your branch to your fork.  
- Open a pull request (PR) from your fork to the main repository, linking it to the issue.  
- Mark it as **Ready for Review** (remove the draft status).  
- Add the **Ready for Review** label.  

### 6. **Review & Approval**  
- The PR will go through code review, where maintainers and contributors may leave comments.  
- Ensure all checks and tests pass before approval.  

### 7. **Merging**  
- Once approved, the PR is merged using a squash commit following conventinal commits for versioning.
